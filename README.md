# How many Hymenoptera?

Raw data for estimations of the number of species of Hymenoptera.  This was initially developed in support of the HexSoTOL project.

## Data

Data are added to a Google sheet which is manually sampled and added to this repository from time to time.

* `data.tsv` - Raw data, manually dumped and slightly cleaned from the Google doc.
* `data.tab ` - Result of the `go.rb` script. 

## Processing

Data are summarizable into a tab seperated text file with the `go.rb` script in this repository.
